# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

### About the project

I have used React router dom to add pages/routes in the app, it gave me possibility to navigate anywhere thorughout the app.
I also showcased mock usage of authentication in the app using Context API.
I have used material UI for Ui components
I use axios for fetching data and interceptors for error handling
I have separated concerns in the folder by names api, components, routes, context, types, utils

I did not add docker and kubernetes because the time wasnt left anymore.
